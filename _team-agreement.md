# Team Aggrement

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts are normal and to be expected. It's best to develop a plan for handling conflicts before they arise.

**This agreement is a *living* document.** If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

## Team name

Phenomenal-Eevee

## To what goals do we all commit?

Submit things (if possible) ahead of the deadline, and create a project collaboratively that we are proud of.

## Weekly meetings

Tuesdays 6-7. Weekdays 9-10 (tentative)

## Meeting "location"

Zoom meetings

## Primary method of communication

Slack.

## How should someone notify the others if they cannot attend a lab or scheduled team meeting?

Slack.

## By when should everyone have their portion of the lab completed?

Before Tuesday's Meeting from 6-7 (or 9-10).

## How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable?

What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

"We wanted to check in with your progress. We feel as though you are not equally contributing your fair share/amount to the overall project and wanted to work out methods with you to address this issue."

"We wanted to discuss what you submitted last time and wanted to make sure that you're up to date with team expectations for work quality."

## What else do we want to include in this agreement?

Maybe your team needs a *fun* clause...

**Tip:** Not everything in life is about work. Sometimes it is important to celebrate too. Consider grabbing a coffee or ice cream at the completion of your project to celebrate!

Eat food/get drinks to celebrate the completion of the project.

## Using your agreement

You are expected to follow your team agreement. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the agreement.** If the agreement isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your conflict using the agreement, please email the instructor at \<info2950\@cornell.edu\>. Please be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the agreement?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your agreement to resolve the issue?" You should attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before an instructor will intervene.
