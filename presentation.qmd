Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## Introduce the data \[Joyce\]

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Highlights from EDA \[Lili\]

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

Research Question #1

**Is the quality of exclusive shows different from non-exclusive shows in a specific platform, for each platform separately?**

(hypothesis test #1)

Tentative: Look into regression model and understand how to interpret confidence intervals

Show p value visualization (aka shade_p\_value)

**Null Hypothesis**: There is no difference in quality of the exclusive shows between the four platforms.

$$
H_0: μ1 = μ2 = μ3 = μ4
$$

**Alternate Hypothesis:** There is a difference in quality of the exclusive shows between the four platforms.

$$
H_A: μ1 ≠ μ2 ≠ μ3 ≠ μ4
$$

**Conclusion:**

1.  To sum it up, the research indicates that exclusive shows on Hulu, Netflix, and Disney Plus tend to have higher Rotten Tomatoes ratings than non-exclusive shows on those platforms, with the exception of Prime Video.

2.  According to the study, there appears to be a difference in the quality of exclusive programs offered by the four platforms, as evidenced by their Rotten Tomatoes ratings. Netflix, Hulu, and Disney Plus has similar average exclusive show quality, while Prime Video's are significantly lower.

**Future work:**

-   Explore other measures of quality for exclusive shows and non-exclusive shows on each platform, potentailly combining ratings from multiple website to form a more objective measurement of quality.

-   Consider other factors that may influence the perceived quality of content, such as viewership, preferences, and number of subscribers.

-   Include more variables in the dataset by joining, in order to rule out confounding variables that might create biases.
